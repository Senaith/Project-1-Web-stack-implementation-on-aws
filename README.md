# Project-1-Web-stack-implementation-on-aws

#### This project will demonstrate how a LAMP stack is implemented on an AWS EC2 virtual server.

### Introduction

Solution stacks are sets of individual components that create a complete environment for application development. The components are usually independently developed, but their frequent combined usage and compatibility qualify them to become a stack. For example, developers need an operating system, a web server, database management software, and a programming language to create a web application. 

LAMP consists of four components necessary to establish a fully functional web development environment. The first letters of the components' names make up the LAMP acronym:

   •	Linux is a free and open-source operating system used to run the rest of the components. Linux is popular in part because it offers more flexibility and configuration options than some other operating systems.
   •	Apache HTTP Server is a web server software used to serve static web pages.

   •	MySQL is a relational database management system used for creating and managing web databases, but also for data warehousing, application logging, e-commerce, etc.

   •	PHP is an open-source scripting language works with Apache to help you create dynamic web pages. You cannot use HTML to perform dynamic processes such as pulling data out of a database. To provide this type of functionality, you simply drop PHP code into the parts of a page that you want to be dynamic. 

This project will give you a better understanding of what the LAMP stack is and how to implement your LAMP stack on Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the biggest Cloud service provider, and it offers a free tier account that we will be able to utilize for our project. For the purpose of this specific project, we will be employing [EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?nc2=h_ql_prod_cp_ec2).

Setting up our Virtual Environment
In order to complete this project, we need to begin by setting up an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS. 
Step one :  
Create free AWS account. Instructions for this can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
